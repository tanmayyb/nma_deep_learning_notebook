# Revision Checklist

# Week 1 BASICS MODULE + Project Day 
Do All skipped Coding exercises 

## Basics And Pytorch (W1D1)
Skipped Konrads Recordings :(, definetely watch. Infact watch on a cinema screen with good speakers.

## Linear Deep Learning (W1D2)

#### Tutorial1 Gradient Descent and AutoGrad
skipped trivial bits, revise autograd?

#### Tutorial 2: Learning Hyperparameters
ski

#### Tutorial 3: Deep linear neural networks
Skipped RSA <= important to know

#### Bonus Lecture: Yoshua Bengio
Watched till end - 10mins

## Multi Layer Perceptrons (W1D3)
Skipped all coding exercises

#### Tutorial 1: Biological vs. Artificial Neural Networks
Section2: Spiral Classification Dataset Skipped. Skipped Coding Exercise (Plotting input neurons of first layer).
#### Tutorial 2: Deep MLPs
