## section 1: Deep Linear Neural Nets

> single nonlinear hidden layer (given enough number of neurons and infinite training samples) has the potential to approximate any function
<p>
shallow nonlinear neural networks hardly meet their true potential in practice. In the contrast, deep neural nets are often surprisingly powerful in learning complex functions without sacrificing generalization. A core intuition behind deep learning is that deep nets derive their power through learning internal representations.</p>

<p>
SVD 'untangles'/decouples the dense layers into parallel independent deep chains of neurons.to understanding the nonlinear learning dynamics of a deep LNN

<p> 
Think! (what does this mean)

In EigenValue decomposition, the amount of variance explained by eigenvectors is proportional to the corresponding eigenvalues. What about the SVD? We see that the gradient descent guides the network to first learn the features that carry more information (have higher singular value)!

increase in singular values correspond exactly to increases in learning at each bump/drop. and svd values increase one-by-one.
